## Project Overview

Smart Shopping List is your adaptive shopping companion that'll transform your shopping experience. From the first item added to your latest purchase, it keenly observes your buying habits. And over time, it doesn't just remember what you buy, but anticipates when you'll need to buy it again. As days go by, it provides intuitive status indicators, alerting you of each item's purchase urgency. Gone are the days where you have to keep mental track of all the things you buy! So, whether it's milk that you buy every week, the artisan coffee beans you indulge in monthly, or the 72lb cheese wheel from Costco you buy every couple of years, your Smart Shopping List has your back.

But what's a smart shopping experience if it's not shared? With a unique 3-word token, you can effortlessly share your list, allowing friends or family to collaborate. Now, you can ensure no item is forgotten, even when you're not the one heading to the store.

With the Smart Shopping List, you're not just shopping - you're shopping smart. üòé
